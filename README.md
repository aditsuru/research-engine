**Research Engine** is an AI-assisted research workflow that combines web search, data storage, and structured collaboration between the user and the model. It is designed to help gather information, organize it, and generate useful written outputs based on the collected material.

**Client Repo Link:** [Research Engine Client](https://github.com/Homies-Tech-Innovation/research-engine-server-client)

### Features

#### Web Search

The system can perform targeted web searches to gather information relevant to the user’s research topic.

#### Vector Database Storage

All retrieved data can be stored in a vector database.

- Users can browse and review stored items manually.
- The AI can reference this data during conversations or reasoning through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

#### Context-Aware Conversations

The AI can use the stored information to discuss the topic, answer questions, and provide insights grounded in collected data.

#### AI-Generated Artifacts

Users can request written outputs—such as summaries, reports, or drafts—which the AI generates based on the stored materials. These artifacts can then be edited by the user.

#### Structured Research Flow

This system follows a guided process to ensure clarity and relevance throughout the research:

1. **Topic Drafting**
   Before any searching begins, the user and AI refine and define the research topic together. This step establishes the context needed for accurate and meaningful results.
2. **Data Collection**
   After the topic is defined, the AI plans how to search the web effectively for that subject.
3. **Selective Storage**
   As information is retrieved, each piece is evaluated. The user and AI decide whether to store the data in the vector database or discard it.
